# Mobile CSS Consolidation - Progress Bar Fix

## Changes Made

### Problem
- Had separate `mobile.css` and `mobile-critical.css` files causing conflicts
- Progress bars (countdown and processing) were not filling up smoothly on mobile
- CSS `!important` rules were blocking JavaScript control of animations

### Solution
1. **Consolidated CSS Files**: Merged `mobile.css` and `mobile-critical.css` into a single `mobile.css` file
2. **Fixed Progress Bar Animations**: Removed `!important` from JavaScript-controlled properties while keeping them for layout properties
3. **Improved CSS Architecture**: Used strategic `!important` declarations only where needed for mobile overrides

### Key Changes in mobile.css

#### Progress Bar Elements (CRITICAL FIX)
```css
/* Progress bar elements - NO !important on JS-controlled properties */
body #countdownProgress,
body #processingProgress {
  height: 100%;
  border-radius: 4px;
  width: 0%; /* JavaScript will control this */
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 1;
  /* CRITICAL: Let JavaScript control these properties completely */
  /* No !important declarations here - JS needs full control */
  background: #DA006B; /* Initial color, JS can override */
  transition: none; /* JS will set proper transition */
}
```

#### What This Fixes
- **Countdown Progress Bar**: Now fills smoothly over 2.4 seconds with color changes (pink ‚Üí orange ‚Üí green)
- **Processing Progress Bar**: Now fills smoothly over 3 seconds with color changes (pink ‚Üí orange ‚Üí green)
- **JavaScript Control**: CSS no longer blocks JavaScript from setting transitions and animations

### Files Changed
- ‚úÖ `/public/styles/mobile.css` - Consolidated and fixed
- üìÅ `/public/styles/backup/mobile-critical.css` - Moved to backup
- üìÅ `/public/styles/backup/mobile-old.css` - Moved to backup

### Files Unchanged
- `/public/scripts/app.js` - JavaScript logic was already correct
- `/public/scan.html` - CSS loading remains the same

## Testing
The progress bars should now:
1. Start at 0% width
2. Smoothly animate to 100% over their designated time periods
3. Change colors during the animation (pink ‚Üí orange ‚Üí green)
4. Work consistently across all mobile devices

## CSS Architecture Notes
- Uses `!important` strategically for layout properties that need to override desktop styles
- Avoids `!important` on properties that JavaScript needs to control dynamically
- Maintains high specificity selectors for reliable mobile overrides
