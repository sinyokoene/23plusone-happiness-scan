**Headlines:**
1. Reconnecting with your senses

**Insights:**
1. Life may feel quite practical or task-focused at times. Paying a bit more attention to what you see, hear and feel can quietly increase your sense of calm and pleasure.
2. It is easy to move through the day on autopilot. Pausing now and then to notice a colour, sound or texture can make moments feel fuller without taking extra time.

## Notes for Copywriter

1. **Tone**: Observational, permission-giving, non-judgmental. Use "You seem to..." and "You may..." instead of definitive statements.

2. **Sentence Length**: Keep sentences readable. Max 25-30 words per sentence.

3. **Action Orientation**: Coach tips should be specific and time-bound ("this week", "today", "one").

4. **Consistency**: All pattern names use "The" prefix except "Holistic Wellness" and "Authentic Expression".

5. **Low Scores**: Frame positively as opportunities, not deficiencies. "You are used to managing a lot on your own" rather than "You lack connection".

6. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Avoid idioms that do not translate well. Keep language internationally accessible.
